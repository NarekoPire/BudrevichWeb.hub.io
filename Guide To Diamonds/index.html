    <h3>The 4Cs</h3>
    <span>The 4Cs are the globally recognised standard for grading the quality of diamonds. Whether you’re an expert or shopping for a forever jewel for the very first time, they’re a vital tool for assessing and comparing diamonds. Here at Budrevich, we encourage you to visit our studio to browse different diamonds and inspect each under a gemmological microscope to gain a better understanding of the 4Cs, which collectively affect the value of your stone. </span>
